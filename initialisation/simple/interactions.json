The ThT fluorescence of cross-aggregates on the L-Phe surface was weaker than that on D-Phe surface. \nThe results clearly indicated surface chirality can strongly influence the structure, \nmorphology, and cellular responses of the cross-aggregates of A\u03b2 and insulin. On a D-Phe surface, A\u03b2 induced insulin to undergo fibrillation and lose its bioactivity. In contrast, on an L-Phe surface, insulin and A\u03b2 formed non-toxic amorphous aggregates, while insulin retained its native bioactivity and mitigated the A\u03b2-induced toxicity.
